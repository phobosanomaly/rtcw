building linux binaries on linux:

type make

make a folder: /usr/local/games/wolfenstein/
copy wolfsp.i386 and wolfspded.i386 in it, also make a subdirectory called: main
put the produced .so files (cgame, ui and qagame) in this main folder, also copy your *.pk3 files from your original installation into this main folder, then you should be able to start the game with the ./wolfsp.i386 command

running a server is only possible if sv_pure is set to 0


building windows binaries on linux:
install the cross tools

type ./cross-make-mingw.sh

put the exe files in a folder, make a subfolder and put the dll's and the pk3 files in it

running a server is only possible if sv_pure is set to 0

copy the wolfsp.app to a folder
